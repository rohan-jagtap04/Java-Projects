This program was created in JAVA for my Programming 12 class as the Final Project.

This is a fully working console Blackjack game. This game was built completely from scratch and includes the following six features:

- Encapsulation
- Ace can be either 1 or 11
- Deck can be split only once
- Running tab of Wins, Loss, and Games Played
- Can enter Custom Names for player and dealer
- Betting for each round between $1-1,000,000


Thank you for playing. Hope you enjoy!
